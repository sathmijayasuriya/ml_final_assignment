## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer globally, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on features extracted from cell nuclei. Four different algorithms were implemented and evaluated for their performance.

## Dataset
The **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** was used for this project. Key details about the dataset:
- **Total Instances**: 569
- **Features**: 30 real-valued features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)
- **Target Variable**: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
- **Class Distribution**: 357 benign, 212 malignant

## Results
The performance of the models is summarized below:

| Algorithm         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| SVM               | 96%      | High      | High   | High     |
| Random Forest     | 94%      | High      | High   | High     |
| Decision Tree     | 90.9%    | Moderate  | Moderate | Moderate |
| Logistic Regression | 86.8%  | Moderate  | Moderate | Moderate |

- **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and find the optimal hyperplane.
- **Random Forest** performed well by combining multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting.
- **Decision Tree** provided interpretable results but is prone to overfitting.
- **Logistic Regression** offered simplicity and interpretability with competitive performance.
